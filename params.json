{"name":"Machine learning","tagline":"Machine Learning algorithms","body":"### Machine Learning sample algorithms\r\nThis page describes about my implementations of Machine learning algorithms. This specifically deals with supervised learning methods. The implementations are carried out mostly in matlab. The core notion is to given a set of data containing relations, the system should be able to learn from the data and able to apply the relations to the new data.\r\n\r\n### Terminologies\r\n### Vector\r\nSet of data that is generally mapped together in a structured format, probably in a matrix form which simplifies its operation.\r\n### Training\r\nThe process where the incoming training vectors consisting of the known labeling or classifications are fed to the system for data aggregation. The training vectors consist of the training vector and its corresponding label vector. This is the data from which the system learns and develops a mode for generalizing other data.\r\n### Testing\r\nThe process where the data that is to be classified is fed to the system. Testing set consists only the data whose classification is decided by the system.\r\n### Features and Weight\r\nThe input vector's classification may depend on different parameters. Those parameters are called as features. In a real-world scenario, not all features are given equal preferences which are otherwise known as weights. These shape the factor that classifies the vector.\r\n### Contact author\r\nMaintained by @sudharsannr\r\nContact the author if it requires any edits.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
